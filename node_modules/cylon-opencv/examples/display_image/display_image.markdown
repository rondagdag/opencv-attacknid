# Display Image from Camera

First, let's import Cylon:

    var Cylon = require('cylon');

Now that we have Cylon imported, we can start defining our robot

    Cylon.robot({

Let's define the connections and devices:

      connections: {
        opencv: { adaptor: 'opencv' }
      },

      devices: {
        window: { driver: 'window' },
        camera: {
          driver: 'camera',
          camera: 0
        }
      },

Now that Cylon knows about the necessary hardware we're going to be using, we'll
tell it what work we want to do:

      work: function(my) {
        my.camera.on('cameraReady', function() {
          console.log('THE CAMERA IS READY!');

          my.camera.on('frameReady', function(err, im) {
            my.window.show(im, 5000);
          });

          my.camera.readFrame();
        });
      }

Now that our robot knows what work to do, and the work it will be doing that
hardware with, we can start it:

    }).start();
